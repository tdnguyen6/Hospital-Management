1. Designing an ERD conceptual schema
	- Accurately captures as much of the semantics of the application as possible
	- All relevant entities, attributes, relationships, cardinalities,
	  speacialization and generalization hierarchies.
--> one and only one relation ship

2. ERD to relational database schema conversion
	- Underline the primary keys for each relations
	- Specify domains for each (relational) attributes
	- Indicate all reasonable referential integrity constraints in italics 
	  (referential constraint)
	* Schema: Students(sid: string, name: string, login: string, age: integer, gpa: real).
	* Instance: fill value
		+ Rows: cardinality
		+ Fields: degree or arity
	- Justify design
	- Advantages from using ERD and disadvantages
	- Indicate all reasonable referential integrity
	  constraints in italics
	* Referential Integrity is set of constraints applied to foreign key which prevents 
	  entering a row in child table (where you have foreign key) 
	  for which you don't have any corresponding row in parent table
	* Referential Integrity prevents your table from having  
	  incorrect or incomplete relationship
	* If you have two tables Order and Customer where Customer is parent table with 
	  primary key customer_id and Order is child table with foreign key customer_id. 
	  Since as per business rules you can not have an Order without a Customer and 
	  this business rule can be implemented using referential integrity in SQL on relational database

3. Creating database
	- Using SQL statements in the MySQL command line tool or SQL Server
	- Primary keys and foreign keys must be implemented
	- Choose datatype
	- Include the database schema diagram and tables description in your report
4. Run queries in Java
(access (select) and modify (insert, update, or delete) data stored on the database server)
